file describing difficulties along the way and their solutions:

* I cannot use localhost. found I need to run the app differently to use any host. By checking exercise definitions I see using 127.0.0.1 is fine so deciding to move on.
* flask shows warning saying this server should not be used in production. for this point I'm just acÂ·knowledging it

flask is not shutting down when terminating the app
